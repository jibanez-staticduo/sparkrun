"""Log source / log line dataclasses — the shape of "where does this workload's output live?"

This module is **data only**, mirroring :mod:`sparkrun.core.cluster_status`.
Production of :class:`LogSource` lives on the runtime
(:meth:`~sparkrun.runtimes.base.RuntimePlugin.log_sources`), because *what*
to read is a property of how the runtime launched the workload; turning a
source into a concrete command lives on the executor
(:meth:`~sparkrun.orchestration.executors._base.Executor.read_logs_cmd`),
because *how* to read it is a property of the substrate.  Reading and
merging live in :mod:`sparkrun.orchestration.logs`; composition lives in
:func:`sparkrun.api.logs`.

The split exists because the two halves genuinely differ per runtime *and*
per executor.  Most sparkrun runtimes use the sleep-infinity + exec pattern:
container PID 1 is ``sleep infinity`` and the serve process writes to a file
*inside* the container, so ``docker logs`` is structurally blind to the
output (see ``scripts/exec_serve_detached.sh``).  A few — TRT-LLM's cluster
mode, Ray *worker* containers — really do put their output on the
container's stdout.  Meanwhile the ``local`` executor has no container at
all and redirects to a host file, and k8s reads through ``kubectl logs``.
Encoding that as data rather than as a print action is what lets the CLI be
a renderer instead of a caller of a printer.

These dataclasses live in ``core`` (not ``api``) so that ``orchestration``
can produce them without importing ``api`` — the layering rule is
``cli → api → {core, orchestration}``.
