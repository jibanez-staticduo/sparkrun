"""KV cache sizing strategies, and the registry that selects one.

Adding an architecture means adding a module here and registering it — nothing
in :mod:`sparkrun.models.vram`, :mod:`sparkrun.core.recipe` or the CLI needs to
learn its name.  See :mod:`sparkrun.models.kv._base` for the contract.

Resolution is **order-sensitive**: strategies are tried by
:attr:`~sparkrun.models.kv._base.KVCacheStrategy.priority`, most specific first,
and the first to claim the model wins.  That is why this is an in-process
ordered registry rather than a SAF extension point — SAF selects plugins by
exact name, which is the wrong question here.  The same reasoning keeps
``platforms/`` in-process.
